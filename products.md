## Connecting to a remote PC
Windows has built in Remote Desktop though the issues you’d likely have would be to do with the firewall (port 3389). There is a 1 user limit on some Windows licences, so it’s essential that you always log out or nobody else can log in.

Xfreerdp is a Linux client for Windows RDP servers.
Other Linux RDP clients are available. There may be RDP servers, so Windows PCs that aren’t allowed to have software installed can be used to access Linux.

"For Linux desktops, we offer VNC or X2Go."  
X2Go operates through SSH so it is secure by default.  
X11vnc is a good VNC client for single user Linux machines, since you get access to the graphics card.
