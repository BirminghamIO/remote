This repo is a community wiki about 'Working From Home'.

This site was created collaboratively, by and for members of the Birmingham, UK tech community, to help local businesses survive, in response to the Covid-19 virus isolation perion. 
It gets a bit technical in places but we shall try to keep the simple things than non-IT people will need clear.

# The general problem: Working At Home 
You are one of a group of people who usually work in the same location, have face-to-face conversations with colleagues, probably supported by IT systems such as email, file services and business-specific software. You attend meetings and chat to colleagues at lunch time. You are part of a community.

* 'For some reason' you need to 'Work-At-Home' or another remote location. You may be working on your own.
* You may be someone responsible for IT solutions who is expected to 'solve the problems', possibly without having prepared.

# Business culture
In the absence of presence as the main measure of work, you may need a different management style. "A hierarchy is a structure made entirely of single-points-of-failure"  
Assume anyone could suddenly get ill and not be able to work at all.  
Managers probably need to give people more freedom and autonomy, relaxing direct control of process and managing outcomes.
If you don't know what workers are achieving now, you probably never did.  
If people are working at home, they may need to fit work around other activities, so be flexible.  

# Home office
Create an appropriate and safe work area. Try to make a clean break between work and home-life.
e.g. sit at a table to work, sit on the sofa in the evening. Some find it useful to have a “commute” or going to work ritual. Watch your posture and the ergonomics of your workplace (right-angles at knees, hips and elbows. Top of screen about level with forehead. Get comfortable. Get up and walk around for a few minutes every now and again. Look out of the window. Keep your feet warm.

# Social isolation; mental health and loneliness
Humans are social animals. Some of us react very badly to isolation.
Someone must stay in touch with all team members, if only for social chat at break times.
Lone workers need to be checked on, to meet employers health & safety responsibilities.  
Relationships with fellow workers need to be maintained so information is shared.
